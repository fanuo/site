title: Get all pictures of the 2010/2011 National Geographic Picture Contest
date: December 22, 2011
---

The yearly National Geographic Picture Contest is one of the most beautiful source of pictures. Check it out [there](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/photo-contest/). Most of the pictures have a downloadable high-resolution version.

# Get the scripts

I wrote some scripts to get them all in one run. You can download  the 2010 script [here](../files/2010.sh) and the 2011 [there](../files/2011.sh). To run them you need curl (included by default in OS X and most Linux distributions). Just type `sh 2010.sh` or `sh 2011.sh`
in the folder of your choice to start the download.

The 2010 collection includes 178 1600x1200 pictures (311Mb total) and the 2011 one has 224 (95Mb total).
